# YTARB -   YouTube Age Restriction Bypass
Changing your date birth isn't enough anymore. In order to watch age-restricted videos you have to verify yourself using personal documents. Not with this script though.

# Description

Bypasses embed videos age restriction. This might be only temponary solution. If YouTube fixes embed age-restriction bypass the only solution will be to download the video using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and then stream it manually. This script detects age-restricted video pages and replaces default youtube player with embed iframe. 

# Installation
Install this script with [Trampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or Violentmonkey etc.) extension avalaible for all modern browsers.

## Install link
Trampermonkey (and similar extensions) should automatically recognize install links:

Otherwise install the script manually.
